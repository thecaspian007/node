Elixir VS Node Vs Python
========================
In case of Python and elixir, we need to handle concurrency with locks(distributed locks with Redis) which need extra efforts.
In case of Node, since it is single threaded it will meet the thread safety and maintains singularity. And with express, making routes are quite easier.

DataStructure/ Stack:
===============
** map: We can easily fetch and insert keys in map but in worst case it might take O(n).

** heap: The search operation here will in O(logn) complexity if sorted.

** Redis with normal key-val pair and sorted set: It will meet the rquirements.
zAdd, zRangeByScore and zRem will solve in O(logn). We can limit offset count by using in LIMIT in zRangeByScore so, that it's complexity being controlled.
and normal set, get on key-value pairs will be O(1);
